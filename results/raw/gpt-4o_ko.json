    "response": "To find the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), we first simplify the field.\n\nNotice that \\(\\sqrt{18} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9} = 3\\sqrt{2}\\). Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{18}\\) is already in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Thus, the field \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) simplifies to \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nNow, we find the degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n1. The degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 2, because \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is a root of the irreducible polynomial \\(x^2 - 2\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n2. The degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is also 2, because \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is a root of the irreducible polynomial \\(x^2 - 3\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n3. To find the degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), we consider \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) as an element of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is \\(x^2 - 3\\), which remains irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) because 3 is not a square in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\).\n\nTherefore, the degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is 2.\n\nFinally, the degree of \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is the product of the degrees:\n\\[\n[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) : \\mathbb{Q}] \\times [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) : \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2 \\times 2 = 4.\n\\]\n\nThus, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 4.\n\nThe correct answer is B: 4.",
