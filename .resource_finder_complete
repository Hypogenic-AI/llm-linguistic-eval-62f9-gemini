Resource finding phase completed successfully.
Timestamp: 2026-01-18T21:50:00Z
Papers downloaded: 5
Datasets downloaded: 2 (MuBench MMLU, Belebele - 15 languages each)
Repositories cloned: 2 (multilingual_analysis, GlotEval)

Summary:
- literature_review.md: Comprehensive synthesis of 5 key papers on multilingual LLM evaluation
- resources.md: Complete catalog of all gathered resources with usage instructions
- papers/: 5 PDFs covering linguistic discrimination, internal mechanisms, benchmarks, and surveys
- datasets/: Samples from MuBench (61 languages) and Belebele (122 languages) benchmarks
- code/: GlotEval (evaluation framework) and multilingual_analysis (PLND for mechanism analysis)

Key Findings from Literature:
1. LLMs show significant performance gaps between high and low-resource languages
2. Models internally convert non-English queries to English for processing (MWork hypothesis)
3. Training data imbalance (92% English in ChatGPT) is the root cause
4. Performance gap does not consistently narrow with increased model size

Recommended Datasets for Experimentation:
- Primary: MuBench MMLU (aialt/MuBench on HuggingFace)
- Secondary: Belebele (facebook/belebele on HuggingFace)

Ready for experiment runner phase.
